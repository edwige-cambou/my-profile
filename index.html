		<h2>Travels ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
		<p>I mainly travelled to European countries with my parents such as in Italy, Spain, England, Scotland, Ireland... And last summer I went to the west coast of the USA and it was incredible. I also particularly enjoy going in trips with friends, indeed last year with my class we had host families in Ireland. </p>

		<h2>CSR ‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
		<p>I have always been sensitive to the subject of ecology, for me this is one of the most important topic of our generation and we need to act now. That's why, I am planning to work in the CSR field after I graduate. </p>
